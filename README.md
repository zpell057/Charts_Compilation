Series of python programs made to create a video compilation of clips of all #1 songs of a decade using various libraries.
This code is still in a draft state.

Current known bugs as of first commit are:
Files being saved with prohibited characters under the windows file system.
Song clips being repeated if the song is #1 at the end of a year and the start of the next.
Text not fitting in the video frame.

It would also be wise to try to find a way to limit the calls made to the youtube search API.
